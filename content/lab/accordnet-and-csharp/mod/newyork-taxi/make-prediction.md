To wrap up, letâ€™s use the model to make a prediction.

We're going to invent a fake taxi trip in New York City. I'm going to get into a cab at Times Square and take a trip to Washington Square Park. The trip covers 2.3 miles and takes 12 minutes. What's the fare I should expect to pay?

We will ask our AI agent to write code that prompts us for all the properties of a single taxi trip, and then we'll use the machine learning model to predict what the fare amount will be.

#### Make A Prediction

Enter the following prompt:

"Add code to prompt the user for all the properties of a single taxi trip, and then use the model to generate a prediction of the fare amount. Ask only for the trip duration, trip distance, rate code ID and payment type."
{ .prompt }

The agent will create a new class `TaxiTripFarePrediction` with a property labelled `Score` to hold the generated prediction:

```csharp
// Class to hold prediction
public class TaxiTripFarePrediction
{
    [ColumnName("Score")]
    public float PredictedFareAmount { get; set; }
}
```

And then it will add code like this to make the prediction:

```csharp
// Create input data
var tripData = new TaxiTripWithDuration();

// Get user input
Console.Write("Trip Duration (minutes): ");
if (float.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out float tripDuration))
    tripData.TripDuration = tripDuration;

...

// Create a prediction engine
var predictionEngine = mlContext.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<TaxiTripWithDuration, TaxiTripFarePrediction>(model);

// Make prediction
var prediction = predictionEngine.Predict(tripData);

// Display prediction
Console.WriteLine($"Predicted Fare Amount: ${prediction.PredictedFareAmount:F2}");
```

The `CreatePredictionEngine` method sets up a prediction engine. The two type arguments are the input data class and the class to hold the prediction.

With the prediction engine set up, a call to `Predict` is all you need to make a single prediction. The prediction value is then available in the `PredictedFareAmount` property.

Let's try this for the fake trip I took earlier. Here is the data you need to enter:

- Trip duration = 12 minutes
- Trip distance = 2.3 miles
- Rate code ID = 1 (standard rate)
- Payment type = 1 (credit card)

And this is the output I get:

{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

I get a predicted fare amount of **$10.70**.

What prediction did you get? Try changing the input data to see how this affects the predicted fare amount. Do the changes in prediction value make sense to you?

Next, let's load the full dataset of 8 million trips and re-run the app to discover the actual regression metrics and prediction accuracy.
