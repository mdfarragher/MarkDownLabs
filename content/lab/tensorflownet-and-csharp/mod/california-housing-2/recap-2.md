Congratulations on finishing the lab. Here's what you have learned.

{{< encrypt >}}

You learned to **split the dataset** into separate parts for training and testing to prevent the machine learning model from memorizing the median house values for every single housing block in the dataset. You used TensorFlow.NET with NumSharp arrays to prepare and process the California housing data, converting it into tensor format suitable for machine learning.

You used **TensorFlow.NET** to create a linear regression model with placeholders, variables, and computational graphs. You trained the model using gradient descent optimization and mean squared error loss. You learned how to create TensorFlow sessions, run training loops, and monitor the cost function during training. You also learned about saving models in TensorFlow's native format and the **ONNX** format for cross-platform compatibility.

And finally, you learned how you can use the trained TensorFlow model to **generate predictions** by feeding new data through the computational graph using the trained weights and biases.

You completed the lab by experimenting with different data processing steps and regression algorithms to find the best-performing model.
