This lab will quickly bring you up to speed with Microsoft’s new ML.NET machine learning library. You’ll gain a solid foundation in machine learning app development, including key concepts such as feature engineering and data analysis, building pipelines, and setting up regression and classification learning algorithms.

As you move through the material, you’ll design, train, and evaluate sophisticated machine learning models directly on your own computer using C# and MLNET.

I'll provide you with all required datasets, source code, and libraries to help you get started and build your own machine learning applications with confidence.
