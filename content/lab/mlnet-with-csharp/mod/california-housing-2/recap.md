Congratulations on finishing the lab. Here's what you have learned.

ðŸŽ“ You learned to split the dataset into separate parts for training and testing to prevent the machine learning model from memorizing the median house values for every single housing block in the dataset.

ðŸŽ“ You used a pipeline to process the California housing data. Extending the pipeline you built in the previous lab, you added the `Concatenate` step to combine all dataset columns into a single feature column to train on.

ðŸŽ“ You used a training algorithm (like SDCA) to train a regression model on the transformed data, and called the `Transform` and `Evaluate` methods to calculate the regression metrics and evaluate the quality of your predictions.

ðŸŽ“ You saved the fully trained model with the `Save` method, and reloaded it with the `Load` method. You also learned about the ONNX file format, which can be used to exchange weights between models running on different software platforms.

ðŸŽ“ You learned that custom data transformations cannot be reloaded, unless they are implemented in a separate class tagged with `CustomMappingFactoryAttributeAttribute`.

ðŸŽ“ Finally, you learned how you can call the `CreatePredictionEngine` method to generate predictions with the fully-trained regression model.

You completed the lab by experimenting with different data processing steps and regression algorithms to find the best-performing model.
