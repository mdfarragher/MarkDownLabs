We are going to use Visual Studio Code to build and edit our machine learning apps. Visual Studio Code is a very nice cross-platform integrated development environment based on Electron that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

This means that you can edit, run, and debug all apps in this course using either a Windows computer, a Mac, or a Linux machine. There's no need to install anything special to work on the labs

You can download the Visual Studio Code installer here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/

After installing Visual Studio Code and launching it, you'll see something like this:

![Run Visual Studio Code](../img/run-vscode.jpg)
{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

And that's it! You now have the NET Software Development Kit and Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. With this, you're ready to start building machine learning applications in C#.
