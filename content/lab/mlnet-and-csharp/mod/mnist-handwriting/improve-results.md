There are many factors that influence the accuracy of your model. These include how you preprocess the images, which classification algorithm you choose, and how you configure the training hyperparameters.

Here are some strategies you can try to improve your model's performance:

- Apply image augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, or shifting to increase the size of the dataset and give the model more data to train on.
- Try different learning algorithms.
- Tune hyperparameters for your chosen learning algorithm.
- Train individual models on each digit, then combine the predictions.
- Train a model to recognize each digit, then train a second model to identify and fix the incorrect predictions.

Experiment with the skills you learned so far. Try to improve your machine learning pipeline and document your best classification metrics for the MNIST dataset.
