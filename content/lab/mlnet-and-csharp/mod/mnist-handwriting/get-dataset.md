Let's start by downloading the MNIST dataset. 

{{< encrypt >}}

Grab the file from here: [MNIST dataset](https://csvbase.com/mdfarragher/mnist-handwriting).

Download the file and save it as **Mnist-Handwriting.csv**.

There are 10,000 rows in this dataset. Each row represents one image in monochrome and resized to 28x28 pixels. The dataset is a comma-separated text file with 786 columns:

- The first column is the row identifier, generated by CsvBase.

- The second column contains the label. It tells us which one of the 10 possible digits is visible in the image.

- The remaining 784 columns are the pixel intensity values (0 .. 255) for each pixel in the image, counting from left to right and top to bottom.

You are going to build a multiclass classification machine learning model that reads in all 785 columns, and then makes a prediction for each digit in the dataset.

Let’s get started. You need to build a new application from scratch by opening a terminal and creating a new console project:

#### Set Up The Project

Now open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create the project (e.g., **~/Documents**), and run:

```bash
dotnet new console -o Mnist
cd Mnist
```

This creates a new C# console application with:

- **Program.cs** – your main program file
- **Mnist.csproj** – your project file

Then move the Mnist-Handwriting.csv file into this folder.

Now run the following command to install the Microsoft.ML machine learning library:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.ML
```

Next, we're going to analyze the dataset and come up with a feature engineering plan.
