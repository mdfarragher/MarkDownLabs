To be able to follow along with the assignments in this course, you will need an Azure Account to create your own machine learning resources in the cloud. Fortunately, Microsoft provides a free trial account with $200 worth of credits to try out their cloud platform.

In this lesson we're going to set up a trial account. If you already have access to an Azure account where you are authorized to create new resources, feel free to skip this step.

First of all, navigate to https://azure.microsoft.com/. You'll see a green **Try Azure for free** button on the page. Click it now to start the signup process.

Click the **Start free** button to confirm that you wish to Start for free:

Now you'll get a login prompt. Enter a new email address that is not already associated with another Microsoft Azure account:

Enter a password and be sure to take a note of it somewhere secure.

On the next page, select the country you are based in and enter your date of birth. Confirm your selection and wait for a short time for the next page to load.

You can now enter more detailed information about yourself:

When you click the blue Next button, you need to confirm your information via phone call or an SMS text message.

Even though this is a free account for the first 12-months, Microsoft will ask you for your credit card details. This is only for identity verification, the card will not be charged during the free period.

Finally, you need to agree to the Microsoft Azure terms and conditions to complete the setup process.

At this point your registration is complete. You can now follow the link to the Azure portal.

Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a shiny new Azure cloud account. Your Azure portal should look something like this:

This is a screenshot of my own portal. Your version will probably have a different Azure service list and an empty Recent resources list. 

In the next lesson, we'll set up the Azure Machine Learning Workspace.
