This lab will quickly bring you up to speed with Microsoft’s ML.NET machine learning library. You’ll gain a solid foundation in machine learning and data science, including key concepts such as feature engineering and data analysis, building pipelines, and training models with regression, binary- and multiclass classification algorithms.

In the lab, you will be using AI agents to generate some of the source code. I'll provide you with prompt suggestions and help you check the quality of the generated soure code and refactor it where needed. You'll build valuable experience creating F# machine learning apps with AI.

As you progress through the material, you’ll design, train, and evaluate sophisticated machine learning models directly on your own computer using F# and the MLNET machine learning library.
