# Conclusion

This concludes the lab on binary classification.

Did you enjoy working with this dataset? Remember, this is real data involving real people that went to the hospital with chest pain and received an official diagnosis. With a well-trained model, they could have received a diagnosis after only a simple interview, blood test and ECG.

Healthcare is a hugely important market for machine learning. Treatment and care is expensive, and the average age of the population in many countries is rising rapidly. Healthcare risks becoming completely unaffordable in the future, unless we use AI-enabled automation to bring the cost of care down.

There are already many examples of AI in healthcare, like automated skin cancer diagnosis, LLMs that perform a differential diagnosis, models that hunt for tumors in MRI images... the list goes on.

As a machine learning practitioner using F# and ML.NET, you can be part of this revolution and help create the building blocks of the future of healthcare! F#'s functional programming features make it particularly well-suited for the rigorous, data-driven work required in healthcare AI.
