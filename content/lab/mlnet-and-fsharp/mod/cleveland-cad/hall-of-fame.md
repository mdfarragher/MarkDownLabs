# Hall Of Fame

Would you like to be famous? You can [submit your best-performing model](mailto:mark@mdfteurope.com) for inclusion in this hall of fame, which lists the best binary classification evaluation scores for the Cleveland CAD dataset. I've added my own results as a baseline, using the transformations I mentioned in the lab. 

Can you beat my score?

| Rank | Name | Algorithm      | Transformations |   AUC   | Accuracy |
|------|------|----------------|-----------------|---------|----------|
|  1   | Mark | L-BFGS + Platt | As mentioned in lab | 0.92 | 0.82% |

I will periodically collect new submissions and merge them into the hall of fame. I'll share the list in my courses and on social media. If you make the list, you'll be famous!
