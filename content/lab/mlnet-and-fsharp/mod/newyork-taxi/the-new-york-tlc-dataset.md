# The New York TLC Dataset

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's yellow taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. Over 200,000 TLC licensed drivers complete approximately 1,000,000 trips each day. To operate for hire, drivers must first undergo a background check, have a safe driving record, and complete 24 hours of driver training.

In partnership with the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, TLC has published millions of trip records from both yellow and green taxis. The taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
