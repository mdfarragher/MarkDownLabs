This lab will show you how to operate cloud-scale machine learning models with the Azure Machine Learning Studio. You will gain a solid foundation in machine learning and data science, including key concepts such as feature engineering and data analysis, and training models with regression, binary- and multiclass classification algorithms.

In the lab, You’ll use the Azure ML Studio designer, a no-code authoring tool, to train and run cloud-scale machine learning models in Azure. The studio designer provides a user-friendly drag and drop interface to build training pipelines, with no Python code required anywhere. You'll have no trouble completing the lessons, even if you're light on software development. 

As you progress through the material, you’ll design, train, and evaluate sophisticated machine learning models in the Azure cloud.
