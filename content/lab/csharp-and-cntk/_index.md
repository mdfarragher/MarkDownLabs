This lab will quickly bring you up to speed with Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit machine learning library. You’ll gain a solid foundation in machine learning and data science, including key concepts such as feature engineering and data analysis, building pipelines, and training models with regression, binary- and multiclass classification algorithms.

As you progress through the material, you’ll design, train, and evaluate sophisticated neural networks directly on your own computer using C# and the CNTK machine learning library.
