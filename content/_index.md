Hi, I'm Mark Farragher, the creator of MarkUp Labs and the author of all the lab modules you'll find here.

I built MarkUp Labs as a place to collect all the lab exercises in my online training courses on MDFT Academy. By putting all my labs on a separate platform, I can offer them to you as a standalone product. So if you're not interested in video lectures but only want to engage in hands-on explorative learning, you've in the right place!

Right now, you'll only find labs for my machine learning courses here. But in the future, I will also add practice labs that complement my Microsoft certification course lectures. Stay tuned, and keep an eye out for updates.

My goal with these labs is to make your learning journey easy and fun. So please dive in, challenge yourself, and see what you can build in one day!
