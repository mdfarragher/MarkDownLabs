Sometimes you're just not in the mood to watch a video lesson and listen to me talk for hours about some super cool subject. You just want to fire up your software development environment and get your hands dirty writing raw code. I get it.

That's why I created **MarkDown Labs**. Here, you will find a large selection of labs that complement the training courses and recorded lectures on the [MDFT Pro Academy](https://www.mdft.academy) website. Each lab explores a specific product or technology and demonstrates how to master a specific skill or build an app in a day.

My goal with these labs is to make your learning journey easy and fun. What will you build today?

[All-Access](https://www.mdft.academy/membership) members have full access to every lab on this site.
