Hi, I'm Mark Farragher, the creator of MarkUp Labs and the author of all the lab modules you'll find here.

I built MarkUp Labs as a collection of interactive lab modules to help you sharpen your tech skills and deepen your knowledge of Microsoft technology. 

Whether youâ€™re enrolled in an MDFT academy course or just want to stay ahead of the curve, these labs are meant to make your learning journey easy and fun. Dive in, challenge yourself, and see what you can build in one day!
