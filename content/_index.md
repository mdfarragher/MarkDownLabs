Hi, I'm Mark Farragher, the creator of MarkDown Labs and the author of all the labs you'll find here.

These labs complement the online training courses and recorded lectures you'll find on the [MDFT Pro Academy website](https://www.mdft.academy). Each lab focuses on a specific product or technology, and will teach you how to build innovative and cutting-edge applications in a day.

I built MarkDown Labs as a place to showcase and share all the cool tech experiments and demo applications I've developed during my long career. My goal with these labs is to make your learning journey easy and fun. So please dive in, challenge yourself, and see what you can build in one day!
