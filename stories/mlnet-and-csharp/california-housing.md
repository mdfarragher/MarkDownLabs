 # The California Housing Dataset

 In machine learning circles, the **California Housing** dataset is a bit of a classic. It's the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's excellent machine learning book [Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646).
 
 The dataset serves as an excellent introduction to building machine learning apps because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and has the perfect size for fast training and experimentation. it was compiled by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry for their 1997 paper titled [Sparse Spatial Autoregressions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016771529600140X). They built it using the 1990 California census data.
 
 ![The California Housing Dataset](../img/data.jpg)
 { .img-fluid .pb-4 }
 
 The dataset contains one record per census block group, with a census block group being the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data. A census block group typically has a population of around 600 to 3,000 people.
 
 In this lab, you're going to use the California Housing dataset to build a model that can predict the price of any house in the state of California.
 
 # Get The Data
 
 Let's start by downloading the California Housing dataset. 
 
 {{< encrypt >}}
 
 You can grab the file from here:
 [California 1990 housing census](https://csvbase.com/mdfarragher/California-Housing).
 
 Download the file and save it as **California-Housing.csv**.
 
 The dataset is a CSV file with 17,000 records that looks like this:
 
 ![The California Housing Dataset](../img/data.jpg)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 The file contains information on 17,000 housing blocks all over the state of California. Here's a description of each column:
 
 -    Column 1: The unique row identifier (added by CsvBase)
 -    Column 2: The longitude of the housing block
 -    Column 3: The latitude of the housing block
 -    Column 4: The median age of all the houses in the block
 -    Column 5: The total number of rooms in all houses in the block
 -    Column 6: The total number of bedrooms in all houses in the block
 -    Column 7: The total number of people living in all houses in the block
 -    Column 8: The total number of households in all houses in the block
 -    Column 9: The median income of all people living in all houses in the block
 -    Column 10: The median house value for all houses in the block
 
 This dataset cannot be used directly for machine learning. It must be cleaned, scaled, and preprocessed—this is what we’ll focus on in the next steps.
 
 #### Set Up Your Project
 
 Now open your terminal (called Windows Terminal on Windows, or Console on Mac/Linux). Navigate to the folder where you want to create the project (e.g., **~/Documents**), and run:
 
 ```bash
 dotnet new console -o CaliforniaHousing
 cd CaliforniaHousing
 ```
 
 This creates a new C# console application with:
 
 - **Program.cs** – your main program file
 - **CaliforniaHousing.csproj** – your project file
 
 Then move the California-Housing.csv file into this folder.
 
 Now run the following command to install additional packages:
 
 ```bash
 dotnet add package Microsoft.ML
 ```
 
 **Microsoft.ML** is the Microsoft MLNET machine learning library. We will use it to build all our applications in this course.
 
 Next, we're going to analyze the dataset and come up with a feature engineering plan.
 
 {{< /encrypt >}}
 
 # Analyze The Data
 
 We’ll begin by analyzing the California Housing dataset and come up with a plan for feature engineering. You won’t write any C# code yet, our goal is to first map out all required data transformation steps to make later machine learning training possible.
 
 {{< encrypt >}}
 
 #### Manually Explore the Data
 
 Let’s start by exploring the dataset manually.
 
 Open **California-Housing.csv** in Visual Studio Code, and start looking for patterns, issues, and feature characteristics.
 
 What to look out for:
 
 -    Are there any missing values, zeros, or inconsistent rows?
 -    Are the values in each column within a reasonable range?
 -    Can you spot any extremely large or very small values?
 -    What’s the distribution of values in columns like median_income, total_rooms, or households?
 -    Are longitude and latitude useful as-is, or will they need transformation?
 
 Write down 3 insights from your analysis.
 {.homework}
 
 #### Ask Copilot To Analyze The Dataset
 
 You can also ask Copilot to analyze the CSV data and determine feature engineering steps. You should never blindly trust AI advice, but it can be insightful to run an AI scan after you've done your own analysis of the data, and compare Copilot's feedback to your own conclusions. 
 
 Make sure the CSV file is still open in Visual Studio Code. Then expand the Copilot panel on the right-hand side of the screen, and enter the following prompt:
 
 "You are a machine learning expert. Analyze this CSV file for use in a regression model that predicts median_house_value. What problems might the dataset have? What preprocessing steps would you suggest?"
 {.prompt}
 
 You can either paste in the column names and 5–10 sample rows, or upload the CSV file directly (if your agent supports file uploads).
 
 ![Analyze a dataset with an AI agent](../img/analyze.jpg)
 {.img-fluid .mb-4}
 
 #### What Might The Agent Suggest?
 
 The agent may recommend steps like:
 
 -    Normalizing income or house value columns
 -    Handling extreme outliers
 -    One-hot encoding categorical features (like location bins)
 -    Engineering new features (e.g., rooms_per_person)
 -    Scaling values for better model convergence
 
 Write down 3 insights from the agent’s analysis.
 {.homework}
 
 #### Compare and Reflect
 
 Now let's compare your findings with Copilot's analysis.
 
 -    Did Copilot suggest anything surprising?
 -    Did you find anything it missed?
 -    Are you confident in which preprocessing steps are necessary?
 
 Try this follow-up prompt based on your observations:
 
 "I inspected the data and found [ .... ]. What kind of preprocessing steps should I use to process this data? And are there any challenges I should take into account?"
 {.prompt}
 
 This back-and-forth helps you learn how to collaborate with AI agents as intelligent assistants, not just code generators.
 
 #### Key Takeaway
 
 Agents are powerful, but they’re not magic. Use them to speed up analysis, but always verify their suggestions through manual inspection and common sense.

 # Plot A Histogram Of Total Rooms
 
 Before you build a machine learning model, it’s important to understand your data visually. Just looking at the numbers, like you did in the previous lesson, may not be enough. A good chart can clearly reveal patterns in the dataset.
 
 In this section, you’ll going to build a visualization to detect any outliers in the **total_rooms** feature.
 
 Let's get started.
 
 {{< encrypt >}}
 
 #### Install ScottPlot
 
 ScottPlot is a very nice plotting and visualization library for C# and NET that can go toe-to-toe with Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. We will use it in these labs whenever we want to visualize a dataset.
 
 First, let's install the ScottPlot NuGet package. In your terminal (inside the CaliforniaHousing folder), install ScottPlot like this:
 
 ```bash
 dotnet add package ScottPlot
 ```
 
 Then open Visual Studio Code in the current folder, like this:
 
 ```bash
 code .
 ```
 
 Open the Program.cs file and remove all existing content, because we don't want the agent to get confused. Replace the content with this:
 
 ```csharp
 using ScottPlot;
 ```
 
 #### Create a Histogram of total_rooms
 
 Now let's ask Copilot to write the code for us.
 
 At the bottom of the Copilot panel in Visual Studio Code, make sure the AI mode is set to 'Agent'. Then select your favorite model. I like to use GPT 4.1 or Claude 3.7 for coding work.
 
 ![Enable Agent Mode](../img/agent-mode.jpg)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 .border }
 
 Now enter the following prompt:
 
 "Write C# code using ScottPlot to generate a histogram of the total_rooms column from the CSV file."
 { .prompt }
 
 And let Copilot write the code for you.
 
 A thing you'll want to check is how the generated code loads the CSV file. The correct approach is to use the method `LoadFromTextFile`, which is part of the Microsoft.ML library.
 
 You should see the following data loading code in your project:
 
 ```csharp
 // Get the path to the CSV file
 string projectDirectory = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();
 string dataPath = Path.Combine(projectDirectory, "California-Housing.csv");
 
 // Create ML context
 var mlContext = new MLContext();
 
 // Load data from CSV
 Console.WriteLine("Loading data from CSV file...");
 var dataView = mlContext.Data.LoadFromTextFile<HousingData>(
     path: dataPath,
     hasHeader: true,
     separatorChar: ',');
 
 // Extract the total_rooms column into an array
 Console.WriteLine("Extracting total_rooms data...");
 var totalRoomsColumn = mlContext.Data.CreateEnumerable<HousingData>(dataView, reuseRowObject: false)
     .Select(row => row.TotalRooms)
     .ToArray();
 ```
 
 This code uses `LoadFromTextFile` to load the CSV file into a data view, which can be used for later machine learning training and evaluation. The code uses a helper class `HousingData` which represents a single row in the dataset.
 
 The code then uses `CreateEnumerable` to convert the loaded data into an enumeration of `HousingData` instances, and a LINQ expression to convert that to a `float[]` containing only the TotalRooms values.
 
 This implementation is by the book, and exactly what we want to see in auto-generated machine learning code that uses Microsoft.ML.
 { .tip }
 
 This is what the HousingData class looks like:
 
 ```csharp
 // Data model for California housing dataset
 public class HousingData
 {
     [LoadColumn(0)] public float CsvRowId { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(1)] public float Longitude { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(2)] public float Latitude { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(3)] public float HousingMedianAge { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(4)] public float TotalRooms { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(5)] public float TotalBedrooms { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(6)] public float Population { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(7)] public float Households { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(8)] public float MedianIncome { get; set; }
     [LoadColumn(9)] public float MedianHouseValue { get; set; }
 }
 ```
 
 Each column in the dataset is implemented as a property, with the correct data type, and annotated with a `LoadColumn` attribute that specifies the corresponding CSV column index, starting from zero.
 
 If instead you get generated code that uses `File.ReadAllLines` or `Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser` to manually load the CSV file, you may want to adjust your prompt and explicitly ask for code that uses `LoadFromTextFile` to load the data.
 
 We want to keep our code elegant and lean. The Microsoft.ML library has built-in support for loading CSV files, so we don't want to import additional packages that clutter up our codebase.
 { .tip }
 
 You may get an issue where the agent struggles with the ScottPlot 5 syntax and tries to generate code for earlier versions. That code will not compile and you'll get errors for the source lines that set up and plot the histogram.
 
 This can happen, because AI agents are trained on data up until a specific cutoff point, and libraries may have changed their APIs after this date. In my testing, I noticed that at the time of this writing (June 2025), Claude 3.7 was unaware of the new syntax and would get stuck in a loop trying to fix my code. I had to abort the agent and fix the code manually.
 
 For reference, [this is how to create a histogram In ScottPlot 5](https://www.scottplot.net/cookbook/5.0/Histograms/).
 
 Here is the plotting code I ended up with:
 
 ```csharp
 // Convert float array to double array (required by ScottPlot 5)
 var doubleData = totalRoomsColumn.Select(x => (double)x).ToArray();
 
 // Create a new plot
 var plot = new Plot();
 
 // Create a histogram
 var hist = ScottPlot.Statistics.Histogram.WithBinCount(10, doubleData);
 
 // Add the bars to the plot
 var barPlot = plot.Add.Bars(hist.Bins, hist.Counts);
 
 // Size each bar slightly less than the width of a bin
 foreach (var bar in barPlot.Bars)
     bar.Size = hist.FirstBinSize * .8;
 
 // Customize appearance
 plot.Title(title);
 plot.XLabel("Total Rooms");
 plot.YLabel("Frequency");
 
 // Save the plot
 plot.SavePng("histogram.png", 600, 400);
 ```
 
 Note the first line, it converts the `totalRoomsColumn` (a `float[]` with all the **total_rooms** values) to `double[]`, because ScottPlot histograms work with double values.
 
 Now let's look at the histogram. It should look like this:
 
 ![Histogram Of TotalRooms](../img/totalrooms-histogram.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 Think about the following:
 
 -    Do you notice the long tail (outliers)?
 -    How should you deal with this?
 -    Could other columns in the dataset have the same issue?
 
 Write down which data transformation steps you are going to apply to deal with the outliers in the total_rooms column.
 { .homework }
 
 #### Create a Histogram of Every Feature
 
 Now let's modify the code to generate histograms for all the columns in the dataset. Enter the following prompt:
 
 "Modify the code so that it creates histograms for every column in the dataset."
 { .prompt }
 
 You should get something like this:
 
 ![Histogram Of All Columns](../img/all-histograms.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 You can see that the **total_rooms**, **total_bedrooms**, **population** and **household** columns have outliers. These are apartment blocks with a very large number of occupants and rooms, and we'll have to deal with them.
 
 #### Summary
 
 Visualization is one of the most important sanity checks in machine learning.
 It helps you spot issues, guide preprocessing, and understand how features behave—even before you build a model.
 
 By using ScottPlot and agents together, you’re learning how to both automate and supervise the exploration process.

 # Plot Median House Value By Median Income
 
 In machine learning training, we're looking for features with a balanced distributions of values. Basically, you want the feature histogram to look like a symmetric hump, with flanks on the left and right tapering to zero. 
 
 But do you remember the histogram of the **median_house_value** column from the previous lab lesson? It looks like this:
 
 {{< encrypt >}}
 
 ![Histogram of Median House Value](../img/medianhousevalue-histogram.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 So why does this histogram have that weird peak on the right?
 
 The peak represents a statistically significant number of housing blocks in the dataset with a house value around half a million dollars. This is an example of **bias**, and it will make it harder for a machine learning model to generate good predictions.
 
 Let's explore this a little further by creating a scatterplot of median house value by median income.
 
 #### Create a Scatterplot
 
 Before we start, let's remove all the old code we don't need anymore. The data loading code can stay but we'll delete all the plotting code because we don't want the agent to get confused.
 
 Always remove dead code, incorrect code, or workarounds you don't agree with from the code base before giving your agent the next assignment. This keeps your code clean and prevents the agent from going off the rails.
 { .tip }
 
 Delete any code you don't need anymore, and don't worry about compile errors. The agent can fix those in the next pass.
 
 Another trick you can use is to add the following comment in your Program.cs file at the point where you want the agent to add new code:
 
 ```csharp
 // the rest of the code goes here
 ```
 
 This will guide the agent to the correct location in your code base where you want to add new code.
 
 Now enter the following prompt:
 
 "Write C# code using ScottPlot to generate a scatterplot of the median house value column versus the median income column."
 { .prompt }
 
 Inspect your new code. Make sure the agent uses `Plot.Add.ScatterPoints` instead of `Plot.Add.Scatter`, because the latter draws lines between the data points, and we don't want that here.
 
 For reference, [here is the ScottPlot documentation on scatterplots](https://www.scottplot.net/cookbook/5.0/Scatter/).
 
 You should get a plot that looks like this:
 
 ![Scatterplot of Median House Value by Median Income](../img/income-vs-housevalue.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 As the median income level increases, the median house value also increases. There's still a big spread in the house values, but a vague 'cigar' shape is visible which suggests a roughly linear relationship between these two variables.
 
 But look at the horizontal line at 500,000. What's that all about?
 
 This is what **clipping** looks like. The creator of this dataset has clipped all housing blocks with a median house value above $500,000 back down to $500,000. We see this appear in the graph as a horizontal line that disrupts the linear 'cigar' shape.
 
 We will have to deal with this in the upcoming lessons, because we don't want a machine learning model to learn that house prices can somehow never be higher than half a million dollars.
 
 #### Summary
 
 Did I mention that visualization is one of the most important sanity checks in machine learning? It not only helped us identify outliers in the total_rooms column, but it also clearly shows clipping in the median_house_value column.
 
 In upcoming lessons, I'll show you how to deal with outliers and clipping.

 # Plot The Pearson Correlation Matrix
 
 When you train a machine learning model on a dataset, you always face the challenge of deciding which columns to include in the training.
 
 You only want to include columns that are uncorrelated with each other. This means that the columns behave independently from one another, and do not increase or decrease together.
 
 In the California Housing dataset, we have two sets of columns that at first glance appear to be highly correlated: 
 
 - **total_rooms** and **total_bedrooms**
 - **population** and **households**
 
 Think about it: a housing block with many rooms will probably also have a lot of bedrooms. And a block with a large population will also host many households.
 
 If we find strongly correlated pairs of columns, we can consider training a machine learning model on a single column. Including the other correlated columns is not useful, because they are not independent variables and we would be wasting valuable algorithmic memory space.
 
 So let's write some code (= have Copilot write it for us) to calculate the correlation matrix.
 
 #### Set Up a Code Structure
 
 In Visual Studio Code, remove all unwanted code from the Program.cs file, and then create the following code structure right after the data loading code:
 
 ```csharp
 // get column names
 var columnNames = (from p in typeof(HousingData).GetProperties()
                    where p.Name != "RowID"
                    select p.Name).ToArray();
 
 // Calculate the correlation matrix
 var matrix = CalculateCorrelationMatrix<HousingData>(housingData, columnNames);
 
 // print correlaton matrix
 PrintCorrelationMatrix(matrix, columnNames);
 
 // plot correlation matrix
 PlotCorrelationMatrix(matrix, columnNames);
 ```
 
 This creates a nice scaffold for the agent to work with. We set up an array of column names (using reflection), and then call `CalculateCorrelationMatrix` to calculate the Pearson correlation matrix. The method is generic so we can reuse it in other projects.
 
 You may be wondering why we calculate the `columnNames` array at all? It's to ensure that `PrintCorrelationMatrix` and `PlotCorrelationMatrix` use the exact same column list and present the columns in the exact same order.
 
  A code scaffold is a great trick to run your agent incrementally, asking it to implement each method in turn. It also forces the agent to use the same data every time, ensuring that the final code works as expected.
  { .tip }
 
 Now we can ask the agent to implement the `CalculateCorrelationMatrix`, `PrintCorrelationMatrix` and `PlotCorrelationMatrix` methods for us.
 
 #### Calculate the Correlation Matrix
 
 Enter the following prompt in Copilot:
 
 "Implement the CalculateCorrelationMatrix method with C# that calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for all columns in the dataset. Use MathNet.Numerics to calculate the matrix."
 { .prompt }
 
 Note how we're guiding the agent by explicitly mentioning **MathNet.Numerics**? We do that, because the Numerics library is the easiest way to calculate a correlation matrix. We can use other libraries (like Deedle or NumSharp), but with Numerics we only need a single call to `Correlation.PearsonMatrix` to calculate the matrix!
 
 If you have a preference for a specific library, mention this in your prompt. This is much better than having the agent pick a library at random and possibly generate convoluted code to make everything work. 
 { .tip }
 
 When I ran Copilot on this prompt, I got a pile of non-reusable code with hardcoded column names everywhere and a ton of local variables to build the jagged `double[][]` array for the correlation matrix.
 
 So I decided I hated it, deleted all the code and wrote this instead:
 
 ```csharp
 public static Matrix<double> CalculateCorrelationMatrix<T>(
     List<T> data,
     string[] featureColumns)
 {
     // Build a jagged array where each inner array is a feature column
     var matrix = new List<double[]>();
     foreach (var col in featureColumns)
     {
         var prop = typeof(T).GetProperty(col);
         matrix.Add(
             data.Select(h => Convert.ToDouble(prop?.GetValue(h))).ToArray()
         );
     }
 
     // Calculate correlation matrix for the feature columns
     return Correlation.PearsonMatrix(matrix);
 }
 ```
 
 My handwritten code uses reflection to access each data column in turn. Then a `foreach` loop builds the jagged array of doubles I need to calculate the correlation matrix. This is much shorter and much more elegant than what the agent generated, it is completely reusable and can be used for any dataset.
 
 Don't hesitate to get your hands dirty and completely rewrite sections of agent-generated code. Treat your AI agent as a junior developer who sometimes gets it wrong and needs to be corrected by a more senior peer. 
 { .tip }
 
 #### Print the Correlation Matrix
 
 Now ask the agent to implement the next method:
 
 "Implement the PrintCorrelationMatrix method to print a nice matrix on the console using unicode lines. Use the BetterConsoleTables package."
 { .prompt }
 
 You should get something like this:
 
 ![Correlation Matrix](../img/correlation-console.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 My agent went a bit overboard and decided to add extra indicators in each matrix cell to show moderate and strong positive or negative correlation. That's a very nice touch.
 
 You can clearly see that the **TotalRooms**, **TotalBedrooms**, **Population** and **Household** columns are strongly correlated. So we could consider condensing them into a single feature for machine learning training.
 
 It's also interesting to look at the final column in the matrix. Notice how only **MedianIncome** is correlated to the median house value? This means that the median income level at the location of the apartment block most strongly affects the median house value in that block. And that makes perfect sense when you think about it. House prices are indeed strongly correlated to neighborhood income level.
 
 #### Plot the Correlation Heatmap
 
 Now let's see if Copilot can generate a heatmap for us with ScottPlot:
 
 "Implement the PlotCorrelationMatrix method to plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix, using ScottPlot."
 { .prompt }
 
 When I ran this prompt, I got a nice heatmap. But closer inspection of the plot revealed several bugs:
 
 -    The numbers in the heatmap did not correspond to the colors of the cells
 -    The colored backgrounds were offset by 0.5 in each cell
 
 After some hacking, I discovered that both axes of the heatmap needed to be shifted by -0.5, and that the vertical axis of the heatmap needs to be in reverse order for the plot to make sense. Here's how you do that:
 
 ```csharp
 // Set the axis limits to show the full heatmap
 // plot.Axes.SetLimits(0, featureNames.Length, 0, featureNames.Length);
 plot.Axes.SetLimits(-0.5, featureNames.Length - 0.5, featureNames.Length - 0.5, -0.5);
 ```
 
 I left the original agent-generated line in, so you can see the changes I made. I reversed the vertical axis, and shifted both axes by -0.5 to line up the tick marks with the heatmap cells.
 
 Despite repeated prompting, my Claude 3.7 agent was unable to fix this bug and kept getting stuck generating code for the wrong version of ScottPlot.
 
  Always double-check the output of your agent-generated code. My initial heatmap looked perfectly fine at first glance, and only after a closer inspection did I notice that the numbers didn't make sense. 
  { .tip }
 
 Here is the final heatmap in all its glory:
 
 ![Correlation Heatmap](../img/correlation-heatmap.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 The correlation blocks are clearly visible now. **TotalRooms**, **TotalBedrooms**, **Population** and **Households** are highly correlated (all numbers go up when housing blocks get bigger).
 
 **Longitude** and **Latitude** are negatively correlated. This makes sense if you think about the shape of the state of California: as you travel south through the state, you also move east because the entire state is angled in the south-east direction.
 
 For machine learning, we are most interested in what correlates with **MedianHouseValue**, our training label. The heatmap clearly shows that there's only a single column with a strong correlation: **MedianIncome**.
 
 #### Create a Utility Class
 
 We'll return to the correlation matrix in later lessons, so this is a good moment to preserve your work.
 
 In Visual Studio Code, select the implementation of the `CalculateCorrelationMatrix`, `PrintCorrelationMatrix` and `PlotCorrelationMatrix` methods (plus any associated helper methods).
 
 Then press CTRL+I to launch the in-line AI prompt window, and type the following prompt:
 
 "Move all of this code to a separate utility class called CorrelationUtils."
 { .prompt }
 
 This will produce a new class file called `CorrelationUtils`, with all of the code for creating, printing and plotting the correlation matrix. You can now use this class in other projects.
 
 When you're happy with generated code and you want to keep it, move it aside into separate class files. That keeps your main code file (Program.cs) clean and ready for the next agent experiment.
 { .tip }
 
 And if you want to clean up your code and make it as side-effect-free as possible, you can edit `PlotCorrelationMatrix` and have it return the `Plot` instance. You can then save the grid in the main program class instead. Your main calling code will then look like this:
 
 ```csharp
 // plot correlation heatmap
 var plot = PlotCorrelationMatrix(matrix, columnNames);
 
 // Save the plot to a file
 plot.SavePng("correlation_heatmap.png", 900, 800);
 ```
 
 If you get stuck or want to save some time, feel free to download my completed CorrelationUtils class from Codeberg and use it in your own project:
 
 https://codeberg.org/mdft/ml-mlnet-csharp/src/branch/main/CaliforniaHousing/CorrelationUtils.cs
 
 #### Summary
 
 The correlation matrix is a great tool to figure out which dataset columns are strongly correlated to the label column we're trying to predict. We must include these columns in machine learning training, because they will strongly contribute to good predictions.
 
 We can also find feature columns that are strongly correlated to each other. These columns can be combined into one. For example, we could combine **TotalRooms**, **TotalBedrooms**, **Population** and **Households** into a new composite column named **RoomsPerPerson**, by dividing the total number of rooms by the population.
 
 In the next lesson, we're going to do exactly that.

# Design And Build The Transformation Pipeline
 
 Now let's start designing the ML.NET data transformation pipeline. This is the sequence of feature engineering steps that will transform the dataset into something suitable for a machine learning algorithm to train on.
 
 {{< encrypt >}}
 
 #### Decide Feature Engineering Steps
 
 After completing the previous lessons, you should have a pretty good idea which feature engineering steps are needed to get this dataset ready for machine learning training.
 
 Write down all feature engineering steps you want to perform on the California Housing dataset, in order.
 { .homework }
 
 Here are some steps you could consider:
 
 -   Normalize every feature in the dataset
 -   Remove outliers with very high **TotalRooms** or **Population** values
 -   Remove the 'clipped' houses with a median house value > $499,999
 -   Condense the **TotalRooms**, **TotalBedrooms**, **Population** and **Households** columns into one or two computed columns.
 -   Bin and one-hot encode the **Latitude** and **Longitude**.
 
 Which steps will you choose?
 
 #### Implement The Transformation Pipeline
 
 Now let's ask Copilot to implement our chosen data transformation steps with an ML.NET machine learning pipeline.
 
 First, remove any code you don't need anymore (for example, the calls to the `CalculateCorrelationMatrix`, `PrintCorrelationMatrix` and `PlotCorrelationMatrix` methods).
 
 Then, enter the following prompt in the Copilot panel:
 
 "Implement the following data transformations by building a machine learning pipeline:<br>- [your first transformation step]<br>- [your second transformation step]<br>- ..."
 { .prompt }
 
 You should now have a nice data transformation pipeline that prepares your dataset for machine learning training. Let's take a look at the code.
 
 #### Removing outliers
 
 If you decided to remove outliers, for example by removing any rows that have **Population** > 5000 and **MedianHouseValue** > $499,999, your code should look like this:
 
 ```csharp
 // Filter out outliers with Population > 5000
 var filteredData = mlContext.Data.FilterRowsByColumn(dataView, nameof(HousingData.Population), upperBound: 5000);
 
 // Filter out expensive houses with MedianHouseValue > 499999
 filteredData = mlContext.Data.FilterRowsByColumn(filteredData, nameof(HousingData.MedianHouseValue), upperBound: 499999);
 ```
 
 The `FilterRowsByColumn` method is a great tool to quickly filter a dataview by a specific column. You can specify upper- and lower bounds for filtering.
 
 #### Adding computed columns
 
 If you decided to create a new computed column like **RoomsPerPerson**, you'll notice a new class definition in your code:
 
 ```csharp
 // Class to hold transformed data including the computed column
 public class TransformedHousingData : HousingData
 {
     public float RoomsPerPerson { get; set; }
 }
 ```
 
 This is a new helper class that holds a single row in the transformed dataset, with an extra property for the **RoomsPerPerson** column.
 
 Your pipeline would then be built as follows:
 
 ```csharp
 // Compute RoomsPerPerson
 var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.CustomMapping<HousingData, TransformedHousingData>(
     (input, output) => 
     {
         output.Longitude = input.Longitude;
         output.Latitude = input.Latitude;
         output.HousingMedianAge = input.HousingMedianAge;
         output.TotalRooms = input.TotalRooms;
         output.TotalBedrooms = input.TotalBedrooms;
         output.Population = input.Population;
         output.Households = input.Households;
         output.MedianIncome = input.MedianIncome;
         output.MedianHouseValue = input.MedianHouseValue;
         output.RoomsPerPerson = input.Population > 0 ? input.TotalRooms / input.Population : 0;
     },
     "RoomsPerPersonMapping")
 ```
 
 The `CustomMapping` transformation uses two class types and a lambda expression to transform the original data and add the new **RoomsPerPerson** column.
 
 #### Bin- and one-hot encode latitude and longitude
 
 If you decided to bin- and one-hot encode **Latitude** and **Longitude**, you'll notice two extra properties in the TransformedHousingData class:
 
 ```csharp
 // Class to hold transformed data including the computed column
 public class TransformedHousingData : HousingData
 {
     ...
     
     // Added properties for transformed columns with nullable arrays
     [VectorType(10)]
     public float[]? LatitudeEncoded { get; set; }
     
     [VectorType(10)]
     public float[]? LongitudeEncoded { get; set; }
 }
 ```
 
 These properties will hold the transformed latitude and longitude, after they have been converted to one-hot encoded vectors. Note that the properties have the attribute `VectorType` set, which indicates that these columns are 10-element `float[]` vectors.
 
 In the main code, you'll find the following transformations:
 
 ```csharp
 // Bin and one-hot encode Latitude and Longitude
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeBinning(
     outputColumnName: "LatitudeBinned",
     inputColumnName: nameof(HousingData.Latitude),
     maximumBinCount: 10))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding(
     outputColumnName: nameof(TransformedHousingData.LatitudeEncoded),
     inputColumnName: "LatitudeBinned"))    
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeBinning(
     outputColumnName: "LongitudeBinned",
     inputColumnName: nameof(HousingData.Longitude),
     maximumBinCount: 10))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding(
     outputColumnName: nameof(TransformedHousingData.LongitudeEncoded),
     inputColumnName: "LongitudeBinned"))
 ```
 
 The `NormalizeBinning` transformation bins the latitude and longitude columns into 10 bins of equal size, and `OneHotEncoding` performs one-hot encoding on these bin numbers to create a 10-element vector of zeroes and ones.
 
 ### Normalization
 
 If you decided to normalize any columns in the dataset, it will look like this:
 
 ```csharp
 // Normalize all columns except Latitude, Longitude and MedianHouseValue
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(nameof(HousingData.HousingMedianAge)))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(nameof(HousingData.TotalRooms)))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(nameof(HousingData.TotalBedrooms)))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(nameof(HousingData.Population)))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(nameof(HousingData.Households)))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(nameof(HousingData.MedianIncome)))
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(nameof(TransformedHousingData.RoomsPerPerson)));
 ```
 
 This stack of transformations will normalize every column except **MedianHouseValue**, **Latitude** and **Longitude**.
 
 These code examples are reference implementations of common data transformations in ML.NET. Compare the output of your AI agent with this code, and correct your agent if needed.
 { .tip }
 
 To actually perform the transformations and get access to the transformed data, you'll need code like this:
 
 ```csharp
 // Apply the pipeline to the filtered data
 Console.WriteLine("Applying transformations...");
 var transformModel = pipeline.Fit(filteredData);
 var transformedData = transformModel.Transform(filteredData);
 
 // Convert to enumerable to verify transformations
 var transformedHousingData = mlContext.Data.CreateEnumerable<TransformedHousingData>(
     transformedData, reuseRowObject: false).ToList();
 ```
 
 This code calls `Fit` to generate a machine learning model that implements the data transformation pipeline. The `Transform` method then uses this model to transform the original dataview into a new transformed dataview. Finally, the `CreateEnumerable` method converts the transformed dataview into a list of `TransformedHousingData` instances.
 
 #### Test The Code
 
 My Claude 3.7 agent added a bit of extra code after the pipeline to output a sample row from the transformed data. My run looked like this:
 
 ![Pipeline Run Output](../img/pipeline-run.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 You can see that I decided to remove outliers by getting rid of all rows with a population larger than 5000. There were 265 housing blocks matching that condition in the dataset. The new computed column **RoomsPerPerson** has a numeric range from 0.0019 to 1.0, this is because I normalized all columns, including this one. And in the sample row, you can clearly see that the latitude and longitude values have been one-hot encoded into 10-element numerical vectors.
 
 Everything seems to be working.
 
 #### Summary
 
 In this lesson, you put on your data scientist hat and decided which data transformation steps to apply to the dataset. The AI agent then generated the corresponding MLNET pipeline code for you.
 
 Coming up with the correct data transformations for any given dataset requires deep domain knowledge and a fair bit of intuition, and this is not something an agent can reliably do for you. Don't fall into the trap of asking the agent to come up with the transformations, because this is your job!
 
 So always make a plan first, based on your analysis of the dataset. Then prompt the agent and ask it to follow your plan.
 
 To wrap this lab up, let's see if we can create a cross product of the latitude and longitude vectors.
 
 {{< /encrypt >}}
 
 # Cross Latitude And Longitude
 
 Now let's perform one final data transformation: we're going to calculate the cross product of the encoded latitude and longitude, to create a new 100-element vector of zeroes and ones. We're layering a 10x10 grid over the state of California and placing a single '1' value in the grid to indicate the location of the housing block.
 
 Let's get started.
 
 {{< encrypt >}}
 
 #### Cross The Latitude and Longitude
 
 Open the Copilot panel in Visual Studio Code and enter the following prompt:
 
 "Add a step to the transformation pipeline to calculate a vector cross product of LatitudeEncoded and LongitudeEncoded, creating a new vector with 100 elements."
 { .prompt }
 
 For me, this prompt worked perfectly on the first try. Claude implemented the cross product like this:
 
 ```csharp
 // Compute cross product of LatitudeEncoded and LongitudeEncoded (10x10=100 elements)
 .Append(mlContext.Transforms.CustomMapping<CrossProductInput, CrossProductOutput>(
 (input, output) => 
 {
     // Initialize the arrays if they're null
     output.LatitudeEncoded = input.LatitudeEncoded;
     output.LongitudeEncoded = input.LongitudeEncoded;
     output.LocationCrossProduct = new float[100];
     
     // Calculate cross product (outer product) of two vectors
     for (int i = 0; i < input.LatitudeEncoded?.Length; i++)
         for (int j = 0; j < input.LongitudeEncoded?.Length; j++)
             output.LocationCrossProduct[i * 10 + j] =
                 input.LatitudeEncoded![i] * input.LongitudeEncoded![j];
     
     // Copy all other fields from input to output
     output.Longitude = input.Longitude;
     output.Latitude = input.Latitude;
     ....
 },
 "CrossProductMapping"));
 ```
 
 It's another `CustomMapping` that uses a nested for-loop to manually calculate the vector cross product.
 
 Note this line:
 
 ```csharp
 input.LatitudeEncoded![i] * input.LongitudeEncoded![j]
 ```
 
 The exclamation mark is the **null-forgiving** operator. It informs the C# compiler that `latitudeEncoded` or `longitudeEncoded` will always be initialized, and suppresses null warnings in this expression.
 
 You should get something like the following output:
 
 ![Cross Of Latitude And Longitude](../img/cross-console.png)
 { .img-fluid .mb-4 }
 
 You can see from the three sampled test rows that the cross product is a 100-element one-hot encoded vector, and that we have only a single '1' value in each vector.
 
 #### Summary
 
 Vector crossing is a handy trick for dealing with latitude and longitude features. Instead of training a machine learning model on two separate 10-element vectors, we now train on a single 100-element vector.
 
 This gives a machine learning model the freedom to treat each grid cell independently from all others. For example, a model could learn that housing blocks in San Francisco are very expensive, but if you travel a couple of miles east, the price drops rapidly. The model will be able to optimize predictions for these two regions independently.
 
 Unfortunately, Microsoft.ML has no built-in transformation to calculate a feature cross, so we had to implement it manually using a custom transformation.

 # Recap
 
Congratulations on finishing the lab. Here's what you have learned.

{{< encrypt >}}

You learned how to analyze the **California Housing dataset**, both automatically by having an AI agent scan the data for you, and manually by inspecting the data by hand. You also learned how to prompt an AI agent to quickly generate **dataset visualizations** with ScottPlot, like feature histograms and correlation heatmaps.

You learned that the California Housing dataset needs a lot of preprocessing before we can use it for machine learning training. The median house values have been **clipped** at $500,000 and there are extreme **outliers** with a very high population and total number of rooms. You also discovered that many columns are strongly **correlated** with each other.

You learned how to prompt an AI agent to generate all the code to set up a **data transformation pipeline**. You learned what reference implementations of common data transformations look like in Microsoft.ML, and are now able to supervise the output of your AI agent for future work.

The dataset contains latitude and longitude columns. You learned how to **bin-, one-hot encode- and cross** them to create a 10x10 grid overlaying the state of California.

# Conclusion

This concludes the section on feature engineering. 

You now have some hands-on experience scrubbing, scaling, transforming, binning, one-hot encoding and crossing feature data with MLNET and C#. You'll use these skills in later labs to optimize your machine learning predictions.

The exact sequence of data transformation steps has a huge impact on the accuracy of machine learning predictions. This is why feature engineering is such an important step in data science.

As you practice with more and more datasets, you will slowly build an intuition for choosing the right transformation step for each feature column in your data.

But until then, just remember to always normalize your data and one-hot encode anything that looks like a category!

# Train A Regression Model

We're going to continue with the code we wrote in the previous lab. That C# application set up an ML.NET pipeline to load the California Housing dataset and clean up the data using several feature engineering techniques.

So all we need to do is append a few command to the end of the pipeline to train and evaluate a regression model on the data.

{{< encrypt >}}

#### Split The Dataset

But first, we need to split the dataset into two partitions: one for training and one for testing. The training partition is typically a randomly shuffled subset of around 80% of all data, with the remaining 20% reserved for testing.

We do this, because sometimes a machine learning model will memorize all the labels in a dataset, instead of learning the subtle patterns hidden in the data itself. When this happens, the model will produce excellent predictions for all the data it has been trained on, but struggle with data it has never seen before.

By keeping 20% of our data hidden from the model, we can check if this unwanted process of memorization (called **overfitting**) is actually happening.

So let's split our data into an 80% partition for training and a 20% partition for testing.

Open the code from the previous lesson in Visual Studio Code. Keep the data transformation pipeline intact, but remove any other code you don't need anymore.

Then open the Copilot panel and type the following prompt:

"Split the data into two partitions: 80% for training and 20% for testing."
{ .prompt }

You should get the following code:

```csharp
// Split the filtered data into training (80%) and testing (20%) partitions
var trainTestSplit = mlContext.Data.TrainTestSplit(filteredData, testFraction: 0.2);
var trainingData = trainTestSplit.TrainSet;
var testingData = trainTestSplit.TestSet;
```

The `TrainTestSplit` method splits a dataset into two parts, with the `testFraction` argument specifying how much data ends up in the second part.

#### Add A Machine Learning Algorithm

Now let's add a machine learning algorithm to the pipeline.

"Add a linear regression algorithm to the pipeline."
{ .prompt }

That should produce the following code:

```csharp
// Combine all features into a single vector column
.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features",
    nameof(HousingData.HousingMedianAge),
    nameof(HousingData.MedianIncome),
    nameof(TransformedHousingData.RoomsPerPerson),
    nameof(TransformedHousingData.LocationCrossProduct))
)

// Add a linear regression trainer to the pipeline
.Append(mlContext.Regression.Trainers.Sdca(labelColumnName: nameof(HousingData.MedianHouseValue), featureColumnName: "Features"));
```

This code adds two new components to the pipeline:

- `Concatenate` which combines all features into a single column called Features. This is a required step because ML.NET can only train on a single input column.
- An `Sdca` regression trainer which will train the model to make accurate predictions.

Be careful when you run this prompt! My AI agent generated a Concatenate step that included all features, including **MedianHouseValue**, **Latitude**, **Longitude**, **LatitudeEncoded**, **LongitudeEncoded**, **TotalRooms**, **TotalBedrooms**, **Population** and **Househoulds**.

This is obviously wrong, as **LocationCrossProduct** replaces all other latitude and longitude columns, and **RoomsPerPerson** replaces all other room- and person-related columns.

Even worse, did you notice the **MedianHouseValue** column in that list? This is the label that we're trying to predict. If we train a model on the label itself, the model can simply ignore all other features and output the label directly. This is like asking the model to make a prediction, and then giving it the actual answer it is supposed to predict. 

So I had to manually edit the list of columns to fix this.

Always be vigilant. AI agents can easily make mistakes like this, because they do not understand the meaning of each dataset column. Your job as a data scientist is to make sure that the generated code does not contain any bugs.
{ .tip }

By the way, SDCA is an optimized stochastic variance reduction algorithm that converges very quickly on an optimal solution. If you're interested, you can read more about the algorithm on Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_variance_reduction#SDCA


#### Train A Machine Learning Model

Now let's train a machine learning model using our data transformation pipeline and the SDCA learning algorithm:

"Train a machine learning model on the training set using the pipeline."
{ .prompt }

That will produce the following code:

```csharp
// Train the model using the training partition
Console.WriteLine("Training the model...");
var model = pipeline.Fit(trainingData);
Console.WriteLine("Model training completed.");
```

The `Fit` method is all you need, it will return a fully trained machine learning model, which has been trained on the specified data using the data transformation pipeline.

#### Summary

In this lesson, you completed the machine learning pipeline you built in the previous lesson, by adding a machine learning algorithm. Then you split the data into a training and testing set, and trained a model on the training set.

In the next lesson, we'll calculate the prediction evaluation metrics to find out how good the model is at predicting house prices.

{{< /encrypt >}}

# Evaluate The Results

Now let's evaluate the quality of the model by having it generate predictions (called **scoring**) for the remaining 20% of data in the test partition. Then we'll compare those predictions to the actual median house values, and calculate the regression evaluation metrics.

So imagine you are a realtor in California selling houses. What kind of prediction accuracy would you consider acceptable?

{{< encrypt >}}

Determine the minimum mean absolute error or root mean square error values you deem acceptable. This will be the target your model needs to beat.
{ .homework }

#### Calculate Evaluation Metrics

Enter the following prompt:

"Use the trained model to create predictions for the test set, and then calculate evaluation metrics for these predictions and print them."
{ .prompt }

That should create the following code:

```csharp
// Use the trained model to create predictions for the test set
Console.WriteLine("Evaluating the model...");
var predictions = model.Transform(testingData);

// Evaluate the model's performance
var metrics = mlContext.Regression.Evaluate(predictions, labelColumnName: nameof(HousingData.MedianHouseValue), scoreColumnName: "Score");

// Print evaluation metrics
Console.WriteLine("Model evaluation metrics:");
Console.WriteLine($"  R-squared: {metrics.RSquared:F4}");
Console.WriteLine($"  Mean Absolute Error: {metrics.MeanAbsoluteError:F4}");
Console.WriteLine($"  Mean Squared Error: {metrics.MeanSquaredError:F4}");
Console.WriteLine($"  Root Mean Squared Error: {metrics.RootMeanSquaredError:F4}");
```

This code calls `Transform` to set up predictions for every single housing block record in the test partition. The `Evaluate` method then compares these predictions to the actual median house prices and automatically calculates these metrics:

- **RSquared**: this is the coefficient of determination, a common evaluation metric for regression models. It tells you how well your model explains the variance in the data, or how good the predictions are compared to simply predicting the mean.
- **RootMeanSquaredError**: this is the root mean squared error or RMSE value. It’s the go-to metric in the field of machine learning to evaluate models and rate their accuracy. RMSE represents the length of a vector in n-dimensional space, made up of the error in each individual prediction.
- **MeanSquaredError**: this is the mean squared error, or MSE value. Note that RMSE and MSE are related: RMSE is the square root of MSE.
- **MeanAbsoluteError**: this is the mean absolute prediction error.

Note that both RMSE and MAE are expressed in dollars. They can both be interpreted as a kind of 'average error' value, but the RMSE will respond much more strongly to large prediction errors. Therefore, if RMSE > MAE, it means the model struggles with some predictions and generates relatively large errors. 

Also note that the `Evaluate` method refers to two columns:

- `labelColumnName` is the name of the column in the dataset that holds the label. For our California Housing dataset, this is **MedianHouseValue**.
- `scoreColumnName` is the name of the column in the dataset that holds the predictions generated by the `Transform` method. This column is named **Score** and was automatically added.

You should get the following output:

![Regression Model Evaluation](../img/evaluate.jpg)
{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

Let's analyze my results:

The R-squared value is **0.6013**. This means the model is able to explain ~60% of the variance in housing prices. This is not bad, it's capturing a majority of the pattern in the data, but still leaves ~40% unexplained. This indicates a moderate-to-strong fit, and for real-world housing data, we could consider this a reasonable result.

The mean absolute error (MAE) is **$42,760**. So on average, the model's predictions are off by about $42k. That's not bad at all, given that the most expensive house in our dataset is $500k.

The mean squared error (MSE) is **~3.65 billion**. Large errors are penalized much more heavily in this metric because of the squaring, so this large number indicates the presence of some high-error predictions.

The root mean squared error (RMSE) is **~$60,439**. This metric is similar to MAE, but gives more weight to large errors. The fact that the RMSE > MAE suggests that the model occasionally makes big errors in its predictions.

So how did your model do?

Compare your model with the target you set earlier. Did it make predictions that beat the target? Are you happy with the predictive quality of your model? Feel free to experiment with other learning algorithms to try and get a better result.
{ .homework }

#### Summary

Evaluation is an essential step in machine learning, because this is where we check if the predictions our model is making are any good. If our model cannot beat the target we set, we'll have to go back to the drawing board and tweak the data transformations or pick a different learning algorithm.

A target of $50k is perfectly reasonable for housing, it means you'll accept a 10% prediction error for houses worth $500k. And the SDCA learning algorithm combined with all the data transformations we discussed was able to beat that target.

Let's continue working on our machine learning app and add a couple more features.

{{< /encrypt >}}

# Save And Load The Model

When you have a machine learning model with good prediction quality, you may want to save the model to a file so that you can easily use it later.

Saving a model will export all of the internal model weights, which represent the knowledge the model has gathered during the training. These weights are just a series of numbers, and saving these numbers to a file safeguards this knowledge and makes it available for later use.

{{< encrypt >}}

When we want to use a model to make predictions, we can simply set up a blank machine learning model, and then load knowledge into it by importing the weights back in to the model. This bypasses the entire training process, which is great because training a large model can sometimes take weeks or months!

Let's enhance our app with some simple code to save the weights of the fully trained model to a file.

#### Save The Model

Open Visual Studio Code and enter this prompt in the Copilot panel:

"Add code to save the fully trained model to a file."
{ .prompt }

Your agent should generate the following code:

```csharp
// Save the trained model to a file
string modelPath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "CaliforniaHousingModel.zip");
mlContext.Model.Save(model, trainingData.Schema, modelPath);
```

Saving a model is super easy. The `Save` method takes three arguments, a model instance, the dataset schema, and the path to save the weights to.

The generated ZIP file looks like this:

![Model Zip File Contents](../img/model-zip.jpg)
{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

The archive contains a **Version.txt** file, a **Schema** file that describes the dataset schema, a list of subfolders that describe each data transformation in the pipeline, and a **Model.key** file with the trained model weights.

The model weights are stored in a Microsoft-specific format. This is fine if you are only using the ML.NET library and you're not transferring knowledge between models running on different machine learning libraries.

However, you can transfer knowledge if you want to. There's a special universal file format called ONNX that you can use to transfer knowledge between machine learning models running on different platforms.

#### Save The Model In ONNX Format

So let's modify our app to use the ONNX format instead. Enter the following prompt:

"Add code to save the fully trained model to a file in the ONNX format."
{ .prompt }

Your AI agent will discover that ONNX is not supported in ML.NET and requires a separate NuGet package. You'll see something like this in the chat:

_"It seems that the ConvertToOnnx method is not available in the current ML.NET version or setup. To save the model in ONNX format, you may need to use the Microsoft.ML.OnnxConverter package."_

And then your agent will execute the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.ML.OnnxConverter
```

This is where agentic coding really shines. The AI agent analyzed the code, discovered that it needed an additional package, installed the package, and then added the code to save the model. It might even have built your code to check that there are no compile errors, or ran the code to check that it really does output an .onnx file.

Don't hesitate to ask the AI agent to build or run your code to check that it is working correctly. This is where unit tests come in really handy, you can tell the agent its code must pass all tests. 
{ .tip }

The code to save the model as an ONNX file looks like this:

```csharp
// Save the trained model to a file in the ONNX format
string onnxModelPath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "CaliforniaHousingModel.onnx");
using (var stream = File.Create(onnxModelPath))
{
    mlContext.Model.ConvertToOnnx(model, trainingData, stream);
}
```

The official Microsoft documentation for saving a model in the ONNX format is here:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/save-load-machine-learning-models-ml-net

#### Loading The Model

Let's add some code to load the model from a file. We can also have the app ask us if we want to train the model or simply load it from a file directly.

First, remove the ONNX code. This file format doesn't support all data transformations available in ML.NET, and we don't want distracting runtime errors while we expand the app. We'll only use the Microsoft format going forward.

Then, enter the following prompt:

"Add code to load the model from a file. When the app starts, ask the user if they want to train a model and save it to a file, or load the model from a file and use it to generate predictions."
{ .prompt }

This will add a query to your app, and based on your decision, it will either train the model and save it, or load the model and evaluate it.

The code to load a model from a file looks like this:

```csharp
// Load the model from a file
DataViewSchema modelSchema;
string modelPath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "CaliforniaHousingModel.zip");
var model = mlContext.Model.Load(modelPath, out modelSchema);
```

Again, very simple. The `Load` method imports a model from a file and expects two arguments: the path of the file, and a variable reference to save the model schema.

Let's test the code. Here's what I get when I choose to train the model:

![Training And Saving The Model](../img/save-model.jpg)
{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

But when loading the model, you're probably going to get a runtime error that looks like this:

![Error Message While Loading The Model](../img/load-model-error.jpg)
{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

What's happening here is that ML.NET cannot run the custom mappings in the data transformation pipeline. If you look closely at the data loading code, you'll see that it is not using the pipeline at all. So the code has no idea how to run the custom mappings and aborts with an error message.

In my testing, I discovered that this bug is too complex for GPT 4.0, GPT 4.1 or Claude 3.7 to solve, and these agents very quickly destroyed my code while looking for a solution. So instead, I propose we debug and fix the code by hand.

It may be tempting to keep pushing your AI agent to fix the code automatically, but in cases like this when the agents are completely out of their depth, just debugging and fixing the code by hand is a lot faster. Plus, you'll learn something new too!
{ .tip }

The error message mentions an attribute `CustomMappingFactoryAttributeAttribute` that can be used to tag assemblies with custom mapping code. So, let's move the custom mappings to a new class and tag it with this attribute.

We have two mappings in our code: calculating rooms per person, and calculating the cross product of the latitude and longitude vectors.

Let me show you how to fix rooms per person, and then you can fix the other custom mappings in your code yourself:

```csharp
[CustomMappingFactoryAttribute("RoomsPerPersonMapping")]
public class RoomsPerPersonCustomAction : CustomMappingFactory<HousingData, TransformedHousingData>
{
    public override Action<HousingData, TransformedHousingData> GetMapping()
    {
        return (input, output) =>
        {
            output.Longitude = input.Longitude;
            output.Latitude = input.Latitude;
            output.HousingMedianAge = input.HousingMedianAge;
            output.TotalRooms = input.TotalRooms;
            output.TotalBedrooms = input.TotalBedrooms;
            output.Population = input.Population;
            output.Households = input.Households;
            output.MedianIncome = input.MedianIncome;
            output.MedianHouseValue = input.MedianHouseValue;
            output.RoomsPerPerson = input.Population > 0 ? input.TotalRooms / input.Population : 0;
        };
    }
}
```

This declares a new class `RoomsPerPersonCustomAction` with the code to perform the mapping.

Then in the pipeline, I can simply do this:

```csharp
// Compute RoomsPerPerson
var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.CustomMapping(
    new RoomsPerPersonCustomAction().GetMapping(),
    "RoomsPerPersonMapping")
```

This is the same CustomMapping call as before, but now I provide the action by using the helper class I declared earlier.

There's one more step: I need to register the assembly that contains the custom mapping code. Here's how you do that:

```csharp
// Register the assembly with custom conversions
mlContext.ComponentCatalog.RegisterAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly);
```

The `RegisterAssembly` method registers the assembly with the custom mapping code (which is actually our main Program class), so that the `Load` method can automatically find the mapping code when it is loading the model weights from a file.

It's all a bit convoluted, but with these fixes everything works.

Fix any custom mapping errors in your code with the technique I just showed you.

By the way, Microsoft has helpful documentation about using custom mappings:

With these fixes in place, the app now works flawlessly when I ask it to load the model from a file:

{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

#### Summary

Saving the fully trained machine learning model is a great trick if you want to use the model to generate lots of predictions. Instead of having to train your model every time your app starts up, you can simply load all the knowledge into a blank model instantly.

We do this all the time in machine learning, because large complex models often require weeks (or even months) to train.

Do be careful with the ONNX format. It's great that we can transfer knowledge between models running on different platforms, but many data transformations (like custom mappings) are not supported. You would not be able to save and then reload the California Housing model in this format.

# Make A Prediction

To wrap up, let’s use the model to make a prediction.

We're going to invent a fake housing block in San Francisco, in the middle of the Mission district. The block has 2500 rooms, 1000 bedrooms, houses 500 people and 150 households. The apartments are 10 years old on average, and the normalized median income in that neighborhood is 2.0.

For how much could you sell an apartment in that housing block?

We will ask our AI agent to write code that prompts us for all the properties of a single housing block, and then we'll use the machine learning model to predict what the median house value will be for any apartment in the block.

{{< encrypt >}}

#### Make A Prediction

Enter the following prompt:

"Add code to prompt the user for all the properties of a single housing block, and then use the model to generate a prediction of the median house value."
{ .prompt }

The agent will modify the `TransformedHousingData` class and add a `Score` property to hold the generated prediction:

```csharp
// Class to hold transformed data including the computed column
public class TransformedHousingData : HousingData
{
    ...

    // The house value prediction
    public float Score { get; set; }
}
```

And then it will add code like this to make the prediction:

```csharp
// Create housing block with data from user
var housingBlock = new HousingData();
Console.Write("Longitude: ");
housingBlock.Longitude = float.Parse(Console.ReadLine() ?? "0");
Console.Write("Latitude: ");
housingBlock.Latitude = float.Parse(Console.ReadLine() ?? "0");

...

// Use the model to predict the median house value
var predictionEngine = mlContext.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<HousingData, TransformedHousingData>(model);
var prediction = predictionEngine.Predict(housingBlock);
Console.WriteLine($"Predicted Median House Value: {prediction.Score:F2}");
```

The `CreatePredictionEngine` method sets up a prediction engine. The two type arguments are the input data class and the class to hold the prediction.

With the prediction engine set up, a call to `Predict` is all you need to make a single prediction. The prediction value is then available in the `Score` property.

Let's try this for the fake apartment I introduced earlier. Here is the data you need to enter:

- Longitude = 37.760653
- Latitude = -122.418725
- HousingMedianAge = 10
- TotalRooms = 2500
- TotalBedrooms = 1000
- Population = 500
- Households = 150
- MedianIncome = 2.0

And this is the output I get:

![Using The Model To Make A Prediction](../img/prediction.jpg)
{ .img-fluid .mb-4 }

I get a predicted median house value of **$143,265**.

What prediction did you get? Try changing the input data to see how this affects the predicted house value. Do the changes in prediction value make sense to you?
{ .homework }

#### Summary

Making predictions with the fully trained machine learning model is super easy. All you need to do is set up a prediction engine and then feed data into it. The engine will perform the exact same data transformations you used when training the model, and this ensures that the predictions make sense.

Using a machine learning model to generate predictions is called inference, and it requires a lot less compute capacity than training the model did. The inference compute load is often thousands of times smaller than the training load.

So it makes perfect sense to run a model in production, where you can quickly initialize it by importing the weights from a file. If over time the data changes significantly and the prediction quality starts dropping (this is called **data drift**), you can re-train the model on a separate compute platform and copy the new weight file back to production.

# Improve Your Results

There are many factors that influence the quality of your model predictions, including how you process the dataset, which regression algorithm you pick, and how you configure the training hyperparameters.

Here are a couple of things you could do to improve your model:

{{< encrypt >}}

- Bin the latitude and longitude into more than 10 bins, thus creating a finer grid over the state of California.
- Use a different learning algorithm.
- Use different hyperparameter values for your learning algorithm.
- Eliminate outliers with a large number of rooms.
- Eliminate outliers with very small populations.
- Try to bin other columns, for example replacing **HousingMedianAge** with a three-element one-hot encoding vector with columns "Young", "Median" and "Old".

Experiment with different data processing steps and regression algorithms. Document your best-performing machine learning pipeline for this dataset, and write down the corresponding regression evaluation metrics.

# Recap-2

Congratulations on finishing the lab. Here's what you have learned.

{{< encrypt >}}

You learned to **split the dataset** into separate parts for training and testing to prevent the machine learning model from memorizing the median house values for every single housing block in the dataset. You then used a pipeline to process the California housing data. Extending the pipeline you built in the previous lab, you added the `Concatenate` step to combine all dataset columns into a single feature column to train on.

You used a **training algorithm** (like SDCA) to train a regression model on the transformed data, and called the `Transform` and `Evaluate` methods to calculate the regression metrics and evaluate the quality of your predictions. You saved the fully trained model with the `Save` method, and reloaded it with the `Load` method. You also learned about the **ONNX** file format, which can be used to exchange weights between models running on different software platforms. You learned that custom data transformations cannot be reloaded, unless they are implemented in a separate class tagged with `CustomMappingFactoryAttributeAttribute`.

And finally, you learned how you can call the `CreatePredictionEngine` method to **generate predictions** with the fully-trained regression model.

You completed the lab by experimenting with different data processing steps and regression algorithms to find the best-performing model.

# Conclusion-2

You now have hands-on experience building a C# app that trains a regression model on a dataset, and then using the fully trained model to generate predictions. This specific dataset, California Housing, required a lot of preprocessing and has features that only weakly correlate with the label. This makes predicting accurate house prices quite challenging. Nevertheless, the best mean absolute error you can achieve is around $28,000.

I hope you also noticed that you cannot simply keep increasing the number of longitude and latitude bins. There's an optimum, and once you go beyond that point, the predictions start degrading in quality again. Knowing where a house is with centimeter-level accuracy is not helpful at all, so we always want to work with a specific level of uncertainty to help our models make better predictions.

This was a fun lab, right?
